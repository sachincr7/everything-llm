The problem arises that when I get to 70-80% this error appears, without any kind of feedback as to what could be the cause.\nCreate an account and your first index with a few clicks or API calls. Use the latest AI models and reference our extensive developer docs to start building AI powered applications in minutes.\nWe\u2019re in the midst of the AI revolution. It\u2019s upending any industry it touches, promising great innovations - but it also introduces new challenges. Efficient data processing has become more crucial than ever for applications that involve large language models, generative AI, and semantic search.\nAll of these new applications rely on \nvector embeddings\n, a type of vector data representation that carries within it semantic information that\u2019s critical for the AI to gain understanding and maintain a long-term memory they can draw upon when executing complex tasks.\nEmbeddings\n are generated by AI models (such as Large Language Models) and have many attributes or features, making their representation challenging to manage. In the context of AI and machine learning, these features represent different dimensions of the data that are essential for understanding patterns, relationships, and underlying structures.\nThat is why we need a specialized database designed specifically for handling this data type. \nVector databases\n like \nPinecone\n fulfill this requirement by offering optimized storage and querying capabilities for embeddings. Vector databases have the capabilities of a traditional database that are absent in standalone vector indexes and the specialization of dealing with vector embeddings, which traditional scalar-based databases lack.\nThe challenge of working with vector data is that traditional scalar-based databases can\u2019t keep up with the complexity and scale of such data, making it difficult to extract insights and perform real-time analysis. That\u2019s where vector databases come into play \u2013 they are intentionally designed to handle this type of data and offer the performance, scalability, and flexibility you need to make the most out of your data.\nWith a vector database, we can add advanced features to our AIs, like semantic information retrieval, long-term memory, and more. The diagram below gives us a better understanding of the role of vector databases in this type of application:\nLast modified \n4m ago",
